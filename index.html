                <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/jacks">Jacks</a></h3>

                <p>Jacks is a framework for building responsive websites. It is based around Ethan Marcotte's book, <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a>.</p>
                
                <p>It's designed to provide a starting point for building sites. It (aims to) provide the standard requirements (some base styles, jQuery, an HTML template) that allows you to easily produce responsive designs.</p>

                <p>This site is mostly Jacks defaults, apart from the width.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/dotfiles">dotfiles</a></h3>

                <p>These are all of my config files for the various applications and utilities I use. It includes (in no particular order): vim, tmux, mutt, bash, irssi, git, screen, gnome-terminal.</p>

                <p>Over time, more stuff is added, and I'm likely to evolve it. I'm yet to remove the configuration for something I rarely use, though (e.g.: screen).</p>
                
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/termisoc-python-tutorial">termisoc-python-tutorial</a></h3>

                <p>This is a simple tutorial designed to be an aid to teaching Python (and programming, in general).</p>

                <p>It includes: a Hello World, the same but with user input, a Fibonacci sequence generator, an example pulling in the Twitter API and the shell of a text-based adventure game.</p>

                <p>The last one is designed to get people hacking away on something - and more importantly, build something neat from a simple position.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/CSS3-Bundle">CSS3-Bundle</a> (for TextMate)</h3>

                <p>I used to use TextMate as my primary editor. I put this together to provide CSS3 support. <em>Note: It could probably do with updating.</em></p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/elements">elements</a></h3>
                <p>Buttons. Simply buttons. Styled using CSS3.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/RestPHP">RestPHP</a></h3>
                <p>A <a href="http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client">rest-client</a> like library for PHP which is designed to make doing RESTful requests easier.</p>

                <h3>Old & No Longer Maintained</h3>

                <p>These we most likely quite useful once. I likely haven't looked at them for a long time. You probably shouldn't use them.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/QuickDialog">QuickDialog</a> &mdash; A fork I maintained to remove ARC compatibility. iOS 5 is now out, so you should use the original.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/sinatra-examples">sinatra-examples</a> &mdash; An attempt to start a repository of examples for the Ruby framework, Sinatra. Didn't really go far.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/mealdiary">mealdiary</a> &mdash; A simple Sinatra app designed to monitor Blood Sugar levels. Built for a friend.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/Chryp-Export">Chyrp-Export</a> &mdash; A tool for getting data out of the blogging engine, Chryp. Probably doesn't work any more.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/authframe">authframe</a> &mdash; A simple user authentication system in PHP. Pretty basic. Also, pretty old.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Who's this?</h3>
                
                <p>This is a projects page by me, <a href="http://nickcharlton.net/">Nick Charlton</a>. I'm a Cocoa/Obj-C &amp; Ruby developer. I also occasionally design thing (mostly for my projects). I'm also a Computer Science Student at Plymouth University.</p>
                
                <p>The idea for this was to have a single place to point people to for projects I've worked on. Especially the Open Source ones. Most of the stuff here is MIT licensed.</p>
